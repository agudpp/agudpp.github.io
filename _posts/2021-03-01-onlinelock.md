# What is onlinelocks

## Little of history

`Onlinelocks` is the not-fancy name we give to a project that we started some years ago with the goal of solving the problem
of opening doors without the need of a key (i.e. digitally with the phone). This problem can be easily generalized to
much more things that just "open" a "door".

The digital lock access "industry" has increased lately and will continue to do, since it has many more benefits than normal 
physical keys, to mention some:

- They are more secure than normal physical keys.
- They are easy to (securely) duplicate in case of lost.
- Can be used remote or in place, and easy to share.
- Better tracking and control management.
- You do not need to carry them phisically :).
- ...

This is not limited to you house or office door, can also be used in lockers, vehicles, parking slots, hotels or 
vacational rentals, and much much more.

The hard part is how to do this in a secure but still easy-to-use way for the final users. And this is what we focused on
from the very first day.


## Problem to solve

The project was targeting 2 niches:

- Normal users that want to open their houses.
- Companies (hotels, airbnb, gyms, etc) that want to provide access to their own customers / clients / users.

There are many features that were implemented in this project
